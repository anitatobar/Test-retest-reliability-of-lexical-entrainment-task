Studies assessing the test-retest reliability of an online lexical entrainment instrument

We established the reliability of an instrument measuring lexical entrainment, or the tendency to use a name that a partner has used before (e.g., using brolly after a partner used brolly), which is a key phenomenon for the psycholinguistics of dialogue. 

Online participants completed two sessions of a picture matching-and-naming task, using different pictures and different (scripted) partners in each session. Entrainment was measured as the proportion of trials on which participants followed their partner in using a low-frequency name, and we assessed reliability by comparing entrainment scores across sessions. The estimated reliability was substantial, both when sessions were separated by minutes and when sessions were a week apart. These results suggest that our instrument is well-suited for differential analyses, opening new avenues for understanding language variability.

Analyses scripts and data can be found in Data&Analysis folder. 
Code for online tasks used in Study 1 (two sessions separated by minutes) and for tasks used in Study 2 (a week gap between sessions) are found in folders with self-explanatory names.
